# ML_Python_RentHop_Kaggle

This is my submission to the Rent Hop competition on Kaggle.

The goal of the project is to develop a multi-class classification model to predict apartment listing demand.

The project covers:

data cleaning and manipulation
feature selection
pca for dimensionality reduction
Logistic Regression, RandomForest, and KNN classifier models in Scikit-learn
grid search, k-fold cross validation, multi-class ROC curves
